This is undetected on all games (minus valorant)
On fortnite, use with caution. This program uses mouse events to send the input, which will get you banned after like 2 reports, and insta ban in tourneys. Or any
EAC based games.

I might eventually remake + use arduino/kmbox to make undetected, but as of now use it on games with shitty anticheats, like Project Nova, PUBG, or any BattlEye game.

This was designed for skidders to sell and hopefully scam a bunch of little kids lmfao. IDRC what you do with it. It is intended to be sold. But at least modify/give me 
credit. Thx
